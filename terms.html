        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Tower Scope is a mobile application that displays the locations of cell towers (base stations) on a map, provides network coverage information, speed test tools, and related telecommunications data. The data is sourced from publicly available databases.</p>

        <h2>3. Use License</h2>
        <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes on devices you own or control.</p>

        <h2>4. Restrictions</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Copy, modify, or distribute the App</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code</li>
            <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose</li>
            <li>Use automated tools to scrape or extract data</li>
            <li>Interfere with or disrupt the App's infrastructure</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Accuracy</h2>
        <p>Cell tower location data is provided "as is" from public sources and may not be completely accurate or up to date. Tower positions are approximate and should not be relied upon for critical decisions. Speed test results are estimates and may vary.</p>

        <h2>6. Premium Subscription</h2>
        <p><strong>6.1</strong> Some features require a paid Premium subscription. Available plans include weekly, monthly, and annual subscriptions.</p>
        <p><strong>6.2 Free Trial:</strong> The annual plan includes a 3-day free trial. If you do not cancel before the trial ends, your subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription at the annual rate.</p>
        <p><strong>6.3 Auto-Renewal:</strong> All subscriptions automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</p>
        <p><strong>6.4 Payment:</strong> On iOS, payment is charged to your Apple ID account. On Android, payment is charged to your Google Play account. The charge occurs upon confirmation of purchase, or at the end of the free trial period if applicable.</p>
        <p><strong>6.5 Managing Subscriptions:</strong> You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>iOS: Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions</li>
            <li>Android: Google Play Store → Subscriptions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Tower Scope shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
